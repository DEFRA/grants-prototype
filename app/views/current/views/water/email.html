        <p>Thanks for using the Farming Transformation Fund water grant checker and submitting your details to the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).</p>
        <p>Based on the answers you have provided, your project appears eligible.</p>
        <p>RPA will be in touch when the full application period opens.</p>

          <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">You must not start the project</h1>
          <p>Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.</p> 
          <p>Before you start the project, you can: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>get quotes from suppliers </li>
            <li>apply for planning permission or an abstraction licence</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-size-24 govuk-!-padding-top-3 govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">Average</p>
           This means your project might be successful.

          <p class="govuk-!-padding-top-4">Value for money will be assessed alongside the funding priorities at full application stage and this may impact your overall project score.</p>
          <p>The likelihood of a full application being successful will also depend on the number and value of applications we receive.</p>
